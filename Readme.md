# Pakistani Hackers Target Innovation Technology Board of Technical Education Council Website: A Retaliatory Cyber Attack

## Introduction

In a recent incident of cyber warfare, the official website of the Innovation Technology Board of Technical Education Council (ITBTEC) fell victim to a cyber attack. Pakistani hackers, claiming to be members of the Pakistan Cyber Army, infiltrated the website and defaced its content. This attack came in the wake of an Indian hacker group, Team UCC, boasting about launching a cyber attack on Pakistani cyberspace. The incident highlights the escalating tensions and retaliatory actions in the realm of cyber warfare between the two countries.

## Background of the Hack

The ITBTEC website, accessible atÂ [https://itbtecouncil.org/](https://itbtecouncil.org/), serves as a significant platform for the exchange of technical education and innovation-related information. Pakistani hackers, purportedly associated with the Pakistan Cyber Army, successfully breached the website's security measures. They defaced the website by replacing its content with messages proclaiming their cyber capabilities and intentions.

## Team UCC's Claims and Portal Compromise

Prior to the hack on the ITBTEC website, Team UCC, an Indian hacker group, boasted about launching a cyber attack on Pakistani cyberspace. They claimed to have compromised several portals hosted on subdomains of the Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB). The group boasted about leaking the credentials of these compromised portals, making them public. This act was likely intended to undermine the credibility and security of Pakistan's cyber infrastructure.

## PITB's Swift Response and Mitigation

The PITB's Security Operations Center (SOC) team promptly responded to the cyber attack on the ITBTEC website. Their swift action and expertise allowed them to defuse the attack within a matter of minutes. The PITB's technical team rectified the compromised portals and implemented robust security measures to ensure that such an attack would not be successful in the future. This quick response demonstrates the PITB's commitment to maintaining the integrity and security of their online platforms.

## Retaliatory Response and Deterrence Message

In response to the attack on the ITBTEC website, groups of Pakistani cyber hackers were assembled to initiate a retaliatory cyber attack. The objective of this counter-attack was to demonstrate deterrence and send a clear message to adversaries. The attack aimed to showcase that Pakistan's offensive cyber capabilities are far more advanced than perceived. It also aimed to dispel the notion that sophisticated attackers are exclusively associated with threat actors from other countries. The Pakistani cyber army intends to deal with any public display of such nuisance with an iron fist.

## Conclusion

The recent cyber attack on the ITBTEC website, orchestrated by Pakistani hackers claiming affiliation with the Pakistan Cyber Army, underscores the escalating tensions and retaliatory actions in the realm of cyber warfare between Pakistan and India. While Indian hacker groups like Team UCC have made claims of compromising Pakistani cyberspace, the swift response and mitigation efforts of the PITB's SOC team demonstrate Pakistan's commitment to maintaining the security and integrity of its online infrastructure. As cyber warfare continues to evolve, it is crucial for nations to strengthen their cybersecurity capabilities and engage in diplomatic efforts to prevent further escalation in this virtual battleground.
